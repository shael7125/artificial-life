The bronchii in the human lung are remarkably similar to a fractal tree L-system. fractal.py allows a user to play with parameters of this tree L-system and evaluate the performance of these systems based on the surface area/volume ratio. In the body, this ratio is important to maximize for two reasons:
1) More bronchial surface area means more oxygen uptake and better respiration.
2) More volume of bronchii in the lungs means that there is less volume for air to fill into!
The tree generates within an arbitrarily dimensioned ellipse, which can be easily modified with the parameters at the top. Surface area and volume are calculated by assuming each branch is a cylinder with a diameter equal to the thickness of the line in the 2D representation this program provides.
